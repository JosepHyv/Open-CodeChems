# Open-CodeChems Rules

## setup
* At least must be 4 players (4 spies) to be able to start a game and it also has to be an even number of players to do so. The maximum number of players is 8 and they will be spltted into two teams of same size.
* Each team would have a spymaster, this is the one member who woulb be giving the clues for the rest of the team.
* Randomly 25 words will be selected and 
placed on the screen in a 5-by-5 grid.

## the key
* Each game has one key that reveals the secret identities of the cards on the table. The key corresponds to the grid on the table. Blue squares correspond to words that Blue Team must 
guess (blue agents). Red squares correspond to words that Red Team must guess (red agents). Pale 
squares are innocent bystanders, and the black square is an assassin who should never be contacted at all.

## starting team
* It will be selected randomly. The starting 
team has 9 words to guess. The other team has 8. The starting team will give the first clue 
of the game.

## game overview
* Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames.
* Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. 
* The field operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant, they can chat to determinate the word that will be selected.
* When a field operative selects a word, the its secret identity is revealed. 
* If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing, until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a wrong person, then it is the other team's turn to give a clue and guess. They can also decide not to continue guessing but they are obligated to try to guess at least once.
* The field operatives will also have turns to select a word.
* The first team to contact all their agents wins the game

## giving a clue
* if you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue that relates to some of the words 
your team is trying to gues
* You also say one 
number, which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue.
* Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On later turns, some codenames will 
be covered up, so a clue that is not legal now might be legal later
